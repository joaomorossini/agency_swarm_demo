# Overview

Private demo for Technical Project Manager job application @ Agency AI (creator of the Agency Swarm framework)

# Brainstorm

- Use the agency-swarm framework to create a custom demo
- Give agents the capacity to interact with ClickUp (or Notion)
- Demonstrate creation of a work breakdown structure from project description
- Provide openapi specs for tools hosted on my ai_agent_tool_server
- The agents should know all about Agency AI and VRSEN
- Agents can send reports and follow ups via e-mail and whatsapp
- Presentation
  - Video demo
  - Live demo:
    - Deployed version (probably not)
      OR
    - Notebook version
